# Crime_Data_Analysis
#Here I am accessing the .csv file from my drive,
#But you can get and use this for your project from this drive link `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ugi-yYWJnoiev5cXkDYWVE0QpPvUcnhb/view?usp=drive_link`

#also, you can visit this link to get data `https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present`

Here, I used crime data of Los Angeles from 2020 to the present
there are six figures I have  shown in my project
1. Top ten crimes in Los Angeles 
2. Crime Frequency by Month (2020-2023)
3. Crime Occurrence by Time of Day Each Month
4. Victim Age Group Distribution
5. Top Areas with Most Crimes
6. Top 10 Areas with the Lowest Number of Crimes
# 5,6 figures show extremely high and extremely low values of my data
Lastly, after you run the project, you will see a heat map, which will directly open in your browser; when you zoom in, you can see where crime happens most, which area is most vulnerable, and which areas are less.
